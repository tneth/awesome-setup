## thinkpad awesome theme installer
This is a script, and the required files, to set up an awesome awesomewm config AND MUCH MORE on a thinkpad with a debian-based distro.

## recently fixt
* vim colours same as terminal colors: `set background=dark` in .vimrc
* *easier "beautiful" font colours for theme customisation*
* terminator colours
* tmux status bar colours + time
* mcabber setup + *notification noises*

## important next
* fontconfig config!
* htop colours

## to do
* 138firefox? 138pidgin? mlyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 * 138firefox will need to get rid of that annoying Desktop-spawning
 * **ideally all files are local. Perhaps one version that gets 138-stuff, another that doesn't**
* options for awesome colours/icons/background "work acceptable" version.
* **Try: Except: for battery**

## ISSUES?
Requires awesome 4.0 (default for debian testing+)
by default, uses terminator 1.91 (debian for debian testing+)
Terminal background transparency? Make sure compton is running before launching terminator.
tmux 2.5
